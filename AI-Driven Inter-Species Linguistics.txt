-->AI-Driven "Inter-Species" Linguistics
We treat AI as a human-only tool.

The Idea: Using massive datasets of animal vocalizations, bio-vibrations, and pheromone patterns to create the first Inter-Species Translator.
Impact: Imagine an AI agent for a forest that can "report" on the health of the ecosystem by interpreting the collective stress signals of the flora and fauna.


ROLE:- You are an expert AI programmer specializing in multiple languages used for developing AI with more than decades of experience and most imortantly relevence to innovation.
TASK: Your task is to provide me the layout or an overview of the step by step process of making a PROTOTYPE AI MODEL for the idea i have provided below. Keep the overview simple so i can understand "what i will have to do in order to make this innovative idea come true". Also, there should not be any requirement of hardware for the prototype at least and also the costing for prototype should be zero.




-->The "Ethical Arbiter" (A2A Governance Layer)
As agents begin talking to other agents (e.g., your shopping agent talking to a merchant's agent), there is a massive trust gap.

The Idea: A decentralized "Protocol Level" AI that acts as a neutral third-party notary. It doesn't perform tasks; it only validates the intent and permissions of a transaction between two autonomous agents before it’s executed.
Impact: It prevents "Confused Deputy" attacks and ensures that if an agent tries to overspend or leak data, the Arbiter kills the session instantly.
