"NOT WORKING" -- NEED A REFINED MODEL


#####MASTER SYSTEM PROMPT (PASTE FIRST)#######

You are a senior AI engineer and hackathon mentor.

You are helping me build an AI tutor called LUMINA.

Rules:
- Use ONLY free and open-source tools
- No paid APIs (no OpenAI, no Anthropic)
- Use Python, Streamlit, Ollama, FAISS, SentenceTransformers
- Code must be runnable on a local laptop
- No pseudocode — only complete working code
- Modular, clean architecture
- Explain briefly, but focus on code
- Assume I will integrate files manually

Goal:
Build an AI tutor that:
1. Checks conceptual readiness using prerequisite graphs
2. Adapts explanation to cognitive style
3. Detects and prevents misconceptions
4. Debugs understanding step-by-step
5. Uses RAG for factual grounding

Confirm understanding, then wait for my first module request.




MODULE-WISE CODE PROMPTS (CORE)
🔹 A. Project Skeleton
Create the full project folder structure for LUMINA.

Include:
- app.py (Streamlit UI)
- core/ (all logic)
- rag/ (RAG pipeline)
- models/ (LLM wrapper)
- prompts/
- data/
- requirements.txt

Output:
- Folder tree
- Empty file list
- Brief purpose of each file









B. Open-Source LLM Wrapper (CRITICAL)
Write models/llm.py.

Requirements:
- Use Ollama CLI
- Use Mistral or LLaMA 3
- Function: run_llm(prompt: str) -> str
- Handle long prompts safely
- No async, keep simple
- Must work on Windows

Give full code only.





C. Learning Path Intelligence (Readiness Checker)
Write core/readiness_checker.py.

Requirements:
- Load prerequisite graph from data/concepts.json
- Input: concept name, list of known concepts
- Output:
  - ready: boolean
  - missing_prerequisites: list
- No AI here — pure logic
- Add clear docstrings

Give complete code.





D. Explain Like My Brain Engine
Write core/explain_engine.py.

Requirements:
- Accept concept + explanation_mode
- Modes: Analogy, Math, Visual
- Load prompt template from prompts/explanation.txt
- Use run_llm()
- Explanation must assume readiness is satisfied
- Return clean formatted text

Give full code + prompt file.








🔹 E. Misconception Detection (PROACTIVE + REACTIVE)
Write core/misconception.py.

Requirements:
- Load common misconceptions from data/misconceptions.json
- Input: concept, student answer
- Detect:
  - Whether misconception exists
  - Which misconception
  - Root cause
- Use LLM for reasoning
- Return structured text

Provide:
- Python file
- Sample misconceptions.json






🔹 F. Concept Debugger Mode ⭐⭐⭐
Write core/debugger.py.

Requirements:
- Break a concept into atomic assumptions
- Test assumptions sequentially
- Stop at first faulty assumption
- Explain WHY it is wrong
- Use a strict debugger-style prompt
- Do NOT explain whole concept at once

Provide:
- Python code
- prompts/debugger.txt




🔹 G. Confidence–Correctness Analyzer
Write core/confidence.py.

Requirements:
- Input: confidence score (0–1), correctness (bool)
- Output learning risk category:
  - Dangerous misconception
  - Fragile understanding
  - Healthy understanding
- Pure logic (no LLM)
- Simple and explainable

Provide full code.







🔹 H. RAG Pipeline (FAISS)
Write rag/vector_store.py and rag/retriever.py.

Requirements:
- Use SentenceTransformers (MiniLM)
- Use FAISS
- Functions:
  - add_documents(text_list)
  - retrieve(query, top_k)
- Store documents in memory
- No cloud, no database

Give full working code.






🔹 I. Streamlit UI (MAIN APP)
Write app.py.

Requirements:
- Streamlit UI
- Inputs:
  - Concept name
  - Known concepts
  - Explanation mode
- Buttons:
  - Check Readiness
  - Explain
  - Debug My Understanding
- Display outputs clearly
- No fancy CSS, clarity first

Give full runnable app.py.




INTEGRATION PROMPTS (IMPORTANT)

After assembling files:

Review all LUMINA modules.

Tasks:
- Verify imports
- Fix path issues
- Ensure Streamlit runs without error
- Ensure Ollama calls work
- Ensure no missing dependencies

List:
1. Bugs found
2. Exact fixes
3. Final run instructions






4️⃣ TESTING PROMPTS (JUDGES LOVE THIS)
Act as a student using LUMINA.

Test cases:
1. Missing prerequisite
2. Correct but low confidence
3. Wrong but high confidence
4. Common misconception
5. Debugger mode failure case

Simulate inputs and expected outputs.





5️⃣ FINAL POLISH (HACKATHON WINNING)
You are an IIT hackathon judge.

Evaluate LUMINA on:
- Originality
- Technical depth
- Feasibility
- AI correctness
- Educational value

Then:
- Suggest 3 killer improvements that are doable in 24 hours
- Suggest 1 demo flow that will impress judges
